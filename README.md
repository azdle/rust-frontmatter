# Rust-Frontmatter

Inspired by Hekyll's [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). This
crate extracts any Yaml set between tripple-dashed lines at the beginning of a
string.

For the moment see the tests in src/lib.rs for how to use.

# Status

Proof of Concept

Right now I make no guarantees about anything to do with this library.
